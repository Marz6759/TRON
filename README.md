### Description

Our group has decided to recreate the retro era of Tron by coming up with a terminal-based game inspired by Tron Legacy.
This project utilises several advanced libraries/data structures like;

```markdown

- Ncurses
- SFML
- Vectors
- Unordered_Maps
- Tuples
- Magick++
- graphicsmagick-libmagick-dev-compat

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```
To make this project with g++, simply:
```markdown
g++ -o main main.cpp -O3 -std=c++11 `Magick++-config --cppflags --cxxflags --ldflags --libs` -lncurses -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-audio -lsfml-system
```

### Screenshots

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Marz6759/TRON/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `main.cpp` configuration file.
